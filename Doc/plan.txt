		Proposed Token Ring Diagnosis Features

The TI Token ring chip set has a group of error counters.  These
count the following errors:
	line,
	burst,
	ari/fci,
	lost frame,
	receive congestion,
	frame copied,
	token [only when adapter is the Active Monitor],
	dma bus, and
	dma parity.

Each counter is eight bits wide.  When a counter overflows, a RING STATUS
interrupt occurs with the COUNTER_OVERFLOW bit set in the status
description.  The counter that overflowed is pegged at 255.  The counters
can be read with the READ_ERROR_LOG command.  This command returns the
values of all of the counters, and then zeros all of the counters.

I propose to make all of the counters available via rdiag.  Because the
adapter counters are only eight bits wide, a long integer counter, updated by
the router, will sum the total errors for each adapter counter.  The long
integer counters will be updated upon the following two conditions:
	- a RING_STATUS interrupt due to a COUNTER_OVERFLOW occurs, or
	- a rdiag request for the counter values is received by the router.

Because of the possible delay from when a counter overflows, pegs at 255,
and causes an interrupt, and when the interrupt is serviced, some errors may
be lost.  I will attempt to find a typical number of errors lost in this
case by performance testing.  

Long integer counters will also be kept on the number of pegs that occur for
each adapter counter.  This will provide a way to estimate the real number
of errors that occurred.

I will make enhancements to rdiag to support the following:
	- ability to specify diagnosis of a token ring card in a router,
	- output formatting capability appropriate to machine reading, and
	- a simple XForm forms based interface (invoked as a separate
	  program).
